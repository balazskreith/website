      <description>I am a Software Engineer, passionate about clean, maintainable, and innovative solutions.
Since I know myself, I love build and create things. I got familiar with programming at the age of 9, and since then I have not stopped learning about it. After the high-school I took exams and certificates about computer networks, completed a bachelor degree as a System Engineer in 2010. In my Msc. I switched from studying routing protocols and focused on low-level programming on embedded systems together with high-level machine learning courses.</description>

      <description>ObserveRTC Open-source monitoring solution for WebRTC applications.
Website: https://observertc.org/
gst-mprtp Multipath extension of Real-Time Protocol (MPRTP) makes real-time multimedia communication capable of transferring on multiple path. I made a Gstreamer plugin capable of sending and receiving packets on multiple path.

ntrt Network Traffic Rate Tracker (NTRT) is yet another analytical tool for network monitoring. The aim of the project is to create a lightweight low-level fast packet monitoring tool in order to track, and accumulate network traffics going through network interfaces.</description>
